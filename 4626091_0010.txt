This reei of microfiim contains materiei ρ
which hes peper coior changes, stains, or
illustrations (some of which may appear on
peges mixed with printed text). in order to

ensure thet eii text end illustrations ere

ieqibie‚ exposure settinqs must be changed.
Therefore‚ when text enci illustratione exist
in a sinqie image or when materiei
becquounds dis-ier, such frames may need
to be exposed twice.
. The first exposure reflects the camere

’ . operator’s best effort to capture the majority

of the text; the second exposure reflects the
camere operator’s best estort to capture
iliustretive materiei or the remaining text. it
is hoped thet this practice witi resuit in e
microfiim product thet fuiiy serves the needs
of most reseeroiiers. ”
